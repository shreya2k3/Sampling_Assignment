## Introduction

Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in the financial industry. This project explores the use of machine learning models to identify fraudulent transactions. Different models and sampling techniques are evaluated to improve the accuracy of fraud detection.

## Models

The following machine learning models are implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Sampling Techniques

To handle imbalanced data, various sampling techniques are applied:

- Random OverSampling
- Random UnderSampling
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)
- BorderlineSMOTE

## Results

The accuracy of each model is evaluated with different sampling techniques. Results are presented in a table format to compare the performance of each combination.

## Prerequisites

- Python (3.x)
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, matplotlib
